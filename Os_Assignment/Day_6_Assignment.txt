Ques - Explain the second field in ps -elf output?

 1. ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed information, use top(1) instead.

       This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:

       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.
	   
 2. To get info about threads: ps -eLf
